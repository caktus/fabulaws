FabulAWS
========

`FabulAWS <https://github.com/caktus/fabulaws>`_ began as a tool to create
ephemeral EC2 instances using Python, like so::

    from fabulaws.ec2 import MicroLucidInstance

    with MicroLucidInstance():
        run('uname -a')

FabulAWS is now a fully-featured tool for deploying Python web applications
to autoscaling-enabled AWS EC2 environments.

Please refer to the `documentation <http://fabulaws.readthedocs.org/>`_ for
details.
